Hi, I'm Martin Pichler. I am an aspiring software developer from Linz, Upper Austria. Visit my website to learn more about me. View my past and future projects and get in touch with me.

I drive to refine my algorithms more and more, to achieve the best performance possible.

Currently I am developing functional, sleek-looking software at a local software company.
